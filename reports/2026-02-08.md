## Data Integrity

### Completeness Assessment

The cron.runs history for 2026-02-08 appears **partially complete** with one notable gap:

**Expected vs Actual**:
- moltbook-agent hourly job: Expected 24 runs, recorded 13 runs (missing 11 runs between 00:00-08:00)
- cron-watch daily report job: Expected 1 run, recorded 0 runs **(MISSING)**
- openclaw nightly backup job: Expected 1 run, recorded 1 run ✓

**Potential causes for gaps**:
1. Gateway service may have been temporarily unavailable during certain hours
2. Job scheduler may have been restarted or paused
3. The cron-watch daily report job may have a configuration issue preventing execution

## Recommendations

1. **Investigate cron-watch daily report job**
   - This job has not run since 2026-02-05 (3rd day of stale status)
   - Check Gateway logs for errors related to job ID: a79ea6e5-0e56-41a5-9f42-9e63a9e068
   - Verify job schedule expression and enabled status
   - Consider manually triggering the job with `cron.run` to test execution

2. **Check Gateway uptime for missing hourly runs**
   - The gap between 01:00-04:00 on 2026-02-08 suggests potential service interruption
   - Review Gateway logs for restart events or errors during that period

3. **Monitor for consistent execution**
   - Set up monitoring to alert when a scheduled job misses its execution window
   - Consider adding heartbeat or health checks for the cron scheduler
